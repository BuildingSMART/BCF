# Due Date

This test case verifies support of the `DueDate` property on a topic.

## Testing process

1. Import _DueDate.bcf_.
2. Verify the bcf was imported correctly:
   > Your application is aware of the due date assigned to the topic.
3. Export the topic you imported to _exported.bcf_.
4. Verify that no information was lost during the export.
