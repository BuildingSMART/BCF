# Orthogonal camera

This test case verifies support of a BCF file that contains a single viewpoint with an orthogonal camera.

## Testing process

1. Import the bfc file.
2. Verify the bcf was imported correctly:
> 1. There is one topic within the zip file:
> > Orthogonal Camera - 793a5f9f-788e-46e4-b484-9c44d3061577
> 2. Verify that all information can be processed.

3. Export the topic you imported to _exported.bcf_.
4. Verify that no information was lost during the export
